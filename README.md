🧾 Exploratory Data Analysis on Superstore Dataset

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Superstore.xlsx dataset to uncover key insights about sales, profits, and customer behavior. The primary goal of this analysis is to understand sales patterns, identify profit-driving factors, and explore relationships between key business variables such as Sales, Profit, Discount, Category, and Region. Through this analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights that can help improve decision-making, pricing strategies, and overall business performance.

The project begins with a thorough understanding of the business problem, where the objective was to identify which product categories and regions contribute the most to total sales and profit. Data was then imported and inspected to assess its structure, size, and quality. We reviewed the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, ensuring data accuracy before analysis.

Next, we performed data cleaning and preprocessing by handling missing values through imputation methods and identifying outliers using both IQR (Interquartile Range) and Z-score techniques. Outliers were carefully examined to decide whether they represented genuine business variations or data errors.

To explore the dataset further, summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range were calculated. These measures helped in understanding the central tendency, variability, and distribution of the data. Visual exploration through histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and pair plots was conducted to identify hidden patterns, skewness, and relationships between variables.

The analysis revealed several important insights. For instance, higher discounts generally reduce profit margins, suggesting that discount strategies should be optimized. Some regions and product categories consistently outperform others, highlighting areas for potential growth and investment. A strong correlation was observed between sales and profit, though heavily influenced by discount levels.

The Profit Margin (%) was selected as the key performance indicator (KPI) to evaluate business success. Overall, this EDA project provided a clear understanding of sales performance trends, customer segments, and profitability, offering actionable recommendations for strategic business improvement.
